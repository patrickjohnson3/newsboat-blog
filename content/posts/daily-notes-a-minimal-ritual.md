I keep a daily note. It starts as a timestamp and a blank line. The ritual is simple: capture what happened, what matters, what to carry forward.

Most days it's small: a meeting outcome, a line of code, a phrase that sparks something.

The note isn't for productivity. It's a tiny archive of attention. And attention is the one resource that cannot be reclaimed.

Try it for a week. You might be surprised by what you remember.
