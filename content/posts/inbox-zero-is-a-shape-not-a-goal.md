Inbox zero is the space to think, not the trophy. The point is to keep the lane clear, not to collect cleared lanes.

Sort by intent: delete, delegate, defer, or do. Your future self is a teammate. Leave them an easy handoff.

If you only do one thing today, trim the list so tomorrow feels possible.
